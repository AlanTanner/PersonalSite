# PersonalSite
This is the repo for my hugo blog at [alanctanner.com](https://www.alanctanner.com). It is currently using my [fork](https://github.com/AlanTanner/hermit) of the [Hermit](https://github.com/Track3/hermit) theme created by [Track3](https://github.com/Track3).

It uses a [Github Action](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo) for building and deploying automatically to Azure Static Pages.

# How To
I used this [Microsoft Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo) to get everything up and running.
