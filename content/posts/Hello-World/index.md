It only took 2116 days since I posted that on twitter, but I finally created a personal website! I am not 100% what my rationale for wanting a personal website was back then... But this will be a tech blog, to document what I am interested in and working on. 

I do not know how often I will post, but there is much to learn, and I want to record my experiences! 

My next post will be about the technology I used to create this blog. Stay tuned!
