Hey there! My name is Alan and I am a software developer who simply loves creating automation solutions. I have a real passion for making things run smoothly and efficiently, and I specialize in Xamarin Android, WPF, and C# for Portable Data Terminal (PDT) Scanners and PC clients. I've been working in this field for 8 wonderful years now and I have to say, I'm still just as excited about it as I was on day one.

And let me tell you, managing MSSQL databases is one of my favorite things to do! I just love making sure everything runs like clockwork, so users can focus on what they need to do, without any pesky interruptions. I've got a great understanding of database architecture and design principles, and I'm always looking for new ways to make things even better.

I also really enjoy working in Agile environments, because I find that it brings out the best in everyone. I've got great communication skills and I love being able to share my ideas and technical knowledge with others, whether they are tech-savvy or not.

I'm proficient in object-oriented programming and design patterns, and I've got a solid background in using software development tools like Visual Studio and Git. I'm also comfortable with version control systems and CI/CD pipelines, and I have experience working with cloud computing platforms like Azure and AWS.

I'm a happy-go-lucky problem solver who always strives for excellence. I love coming up with creative and effective automation solutions that make a real difference for my clients and end-users. I'm highly motivated and always ready for a new challenge, and I love working independently or as part of a team. All in all, I'm just a software developer who wants to make the world a better place, one automation solution at a time!
