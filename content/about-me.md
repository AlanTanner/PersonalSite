Hello, my name is Alan, and I'm an experienced software developer. I specialize in creating automation solutions that help businesses operate more efficiently and effectively. With expertise in Xamarin Android, WPF, and C# for Portable Data Terminal (PDT) Scanners and PC clients, I'm committed to delivering high-quality work that meets the needs of clients and end-users.

Throughout my career, I've gained extensive knowledge in software development and data management, particularly in MSSQL databases. I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and finding innovative ways to apply them in my work. I'm particularly excited about the possibilities that AI and cloud technologies offer and enjoy experimenting with new tools and techniques.

When I'm not working, I enjoy playing video games to unwind and have some fun. I find it a great way to clear my mind and get ready for the next challenge. I'm also a big fan of contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other developers to build new and exciting software solutions.

If you're interested in learning more about my work or discussing potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alanctanner) or directly by [alan@alanctanner.com](mailto:alan@alanctanner.com). I'm always eager to share my knowledge and experiences with others and explore how we can work together to create innovative and effective software solutions.
